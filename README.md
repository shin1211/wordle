# Wordle clone app

## Problem:

### getting stuck on how to move on to the next guess(next array) after submitting the first attempt.

## solution:

### created default template with empty string and used for Board component and update

### created useState for current positions (user attempt row and letter position) (not sure this is the best solution)

## Problem:

## When user uses keyboard for inputs after using keyboard simulator on screen for inputs, letters are added with blank cells in between
